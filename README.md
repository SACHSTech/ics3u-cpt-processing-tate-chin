# Platforming Game

# Game Objective

Once entering the game, you are to play as a cat and go around collecting objects that are placed around the map. In total, there are three different objects. Once all are collected, you will be greeted by some winning text. The challenge comes when dangerous spikes are placed at the bottom of the map. You must navigate through the game without touching them. When touched, the game over screen is shown.

# Gameplay Mechanics

The player is able to move left, right, and jump using the left key, right key, and up key respectively. The rectangles that are generated are platforms that you are able to stand on and the dark red triangles at the bottom of the screen represent deadly spikes. The circular objects are what the player needs to collect and are scattered throughout the map. In some parts of the game, there will be rainfall which decreases the height that the player can jump making it more challenging for them to get from platform to platform. You are able to move further left or further right in order to expand the map more. 

# Scoring

The program counts how many objects you have collected out of three. 

# Limitations

Our program places the objects in the same location every time. In other words, the location of the objects is not randomly generated. In a similar manner, the map is the same each time meaning that the platforms are automatically placed in the same spots every playthrough.
