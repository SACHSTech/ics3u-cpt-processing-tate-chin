# Platforming Game

# Game Objective

Once entering the game, you are to play as a cat and go around collecting objects that are placed around the map. In total, there are twenty different objects. Once all are collected, you must enter through a door that is placed in the middle of the screen, and you will be greeted by some winning text. The challenge comes when dangerous spikes are placed at the bottom of the map. You must navigate through the game without touching them.

# Gameplay Mechanics

The player is able to move left, right, and jump using the arrow keys and spacebar respectively. The rectangles that are generated are platforms that you are able to stand on and the triangles at the bottom of the screen represent deadly spikes. Falling onto the spikes triggers a game over screen. The circular objects are what the player needs to collect and are scattered throughout the map. In some parts of the game, there will be rainfall which decreases the height that the player can jump making it more challenging for them to get from platform to platform

# Scoring

The program counts how many objects you have collected out of twenty. 

# Limitations

Our program places the objects in the same location every time. In other words, the location of the objects is not randomly generated. In a similar manner, the map is the same each time meaning that the platforms are automatically placed in the same spots every playthrough.
